*MIDI Schow Control over Ethernet for MA lighting*

This is an implementation of the MIDI Show Control protocol used by MA lighting.
While initially developed for the dot2 lineup it also works for grandMA with
some slight differences which are documented below.

## Limitations
MIDI Show Control inherited some of the limitations of MIDI. While the protocol
is specific to MA lighting control equipment it still has some limitations.
Executor numbers for example are `7 bit`. This means that the highest executor
value available is `127`. Macro numbers can in fact be `8 bit`.

If you are using dot2 you will be limited to the main executor and executors on
the first page. Additionally this implementation is limited to the command
format: `All`.

## Note
While this implementation was initially written for the dot2, it also works for
the grandMA. There are a few differences though. Executor `0` is used for the
main executor on the dot2. If you are using grandMA, executor `0` is actually
the first executor. So numbering of the executors for the grandMA is zero based.

Another important thing to note is that this implementation swaps the executor
and page numbers. While you see fader `1.2` (page 1, exec 2) being sent from the
console it will arive as `2.1`. The reason for this is that the page number is
optional or even useless on dot2 and so you can just drop the fraction.

## Console/onPC configuration
You are required to set the MIDI Show Control mode to `Ethernet`, exec to
`Exec.Page` and the command format to `All`. The rest of the configuration
depends on your needs. In and out ports need to be between `6000` and `6100`
as per the MA documentation and shouldn't be the same to prevent loops.
MIDI channels are ignored when mode is set to `Ethernet`.

## Installation
```sh
$ npm install mamsc --save
```
